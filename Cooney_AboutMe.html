                        I feel that, now in 2018 if you want to succeed in this 
                        world you must attend at least some form of education after 
                        high school.  I knew that I would be going to college 
                        since the fifth grade seeing as how that was when the word 
                        seemed to start being heard when I was around my parents 
                        and relatives more often.  They would always tell me to 
                        "Study hard, so you can go to college Jake!"  I would always 
                        just reply with indifference, not fully understanding the gravity 
                        of having to go to school for another four years.  
                        However, now I understand.  I realize now that if I want 
                        to make money, have a job, and someday start a family, I 
                        must go to college.  So for now, in my life, that is my goal.  
                        Get into a good college.  This means I have to work hard and 
                        get good grades.  I have to do this if I want to one day get 
                        a job, make money, and be comfortable.  
                        <p></p>
                        My name is Jake Edward Cooney and I am a high school student 
                        living with my family in Dublin California.  Seeing as this 
                        is my first year in high school I still have a long way 
                        to go until I do achieve my goal of getting into a good 
                        college but I like to think ahead.  I know that it takes 
                        many things for a good college to accept you, and I do 
                        have a few achievements already under my belt.  First I 
                        have good grades so far into my high school carreer sitting 
                        with mostly A's and a few B's.  However as many teachers 
                        told me that middle school grades "do not really matter", 
                        I was not persuaded by them.  I achieved a 4.0 GPA in nearly 
                        every quarter of my three years in middle school.
                        <p></p>
                        I may be a smart student however I would say that I am 
                        also an acceptable leader when it comes to sports.  
                        Over my short fifteen years on this Earth I have competed 
                        for many sports teams.  My main sports so far have been 
                        football and baseball.  I previously lived on the East Coast 
                        in Delaware before my family moved to California.  When I 
                        moved to California I discovered how truly competitive 
                        baseball really is.  After a few years of getting acclimated 
                        to the better competition in the state of California I 
                        joined a travel baseball team called the Thundersox.  With 
                        my second year on the team I became the captain and lead 
                        our team to numerous championship medals throughout the 
                        next two years.  Then, after our team had finally disbanded 
                        I was entering high school.  This is when I started my 
                        football career.  I met even more new people and made 
                        great friends with many of them.  However all great things 
                        do come to an end and the season ended, our team with a 
                        record of 7 wins and 3 losses.  In the final awards ceremony 
                        I was awarded the MVP award for the season and that was 
                        the end of it.  I hope to make the baseball team in the 
                        spring and work hard for football next season so our record 
                        can be even better.  Thank you for finding out a little 
                        bit about me and feel free to explore the rest of my portfolio.
