                        I feel that, now in 2018 if you want to succeed in this 
                        world you must attend at least some form of education after 
                        high school.  I knew that I would be going to college 
                        since the fifth grade seeing as how that was when the word 
                        seemed to start being heard when I was around my parents 
                        and relatives more often.  They would always tell me to 
                        "Study hard, so you can go to college Jake!"  I would always 
                        just reply with indifference, not fully understanding the gravity 
                        of having to go to school for another four years.  
                        However, now I understand.  I realize now that if I want 
                        to make money, have a job, and someday start a family, I 
                        must go to college.  So for now, in my life, that is my goal.  
                        Get into a good college.  This means I have to work hard and 
                        get good grades.  I have to do this if I want to one day get 
                        a job, make money, and be comfortable.  
                        <p></p>
                        My name is Jake Edward Cooney and I am a high school student 
                        living with my family in Dublin California.  Seeing as this 
                        is my first year in high school I still have a long way 
                        to go until I do achieve my goal of getting into a good 
                        college but I like to think ahead.  I know that it takes 
                        many things for a good college to accept you, and I do 
                        have a few achievements already under my belt.  First I 
                        have good grades so far into my high school carreer sitting 
                        with mostly A's and a few B's.  However as many teachers 
                        told me that middle school grades "do not really matter", 
                        I was not persuaded by them.  I achieved a 4.0 GPA in nearly 
                        every quarter of my three years in middle school.
                        <p></p>
                        I may be a smart student however I would say that I am 
                        also an acceptable leader when it comes to sports.  
                        Over my short fifteen years on this Earth I have competed 
                        for many sports teams.  My main sports so far have been 
                        football and baseball.  I previously lived on the East Coast 
                        in Delaware before my family moved to California.  When I 
                        moved to California I discovered how truly competitive 
                        baseball really is.  After a few years of getting acclimated 
                        to the better competition in the state of California I 
                        joined a travel baseball team called the Thundersox.  With 
                        my second year on the team I became the captain and lead 
                        our team to numerous championship medals throughout the 
                        next two years.  Then, after our team had finally disbanded 
                        I was entering high school.  This is when I started my 
                        football career.  I met even more new people and made 
                        great friends with many of them.  However all great things 
                        do come to an end and the season ended, our team with a 
                        record of 7 wins and 3 losses.  In the final awards ceremony 
                        I was awarded the MVP award for the season and that was 
                        the end of it.  I hope to make the baseball team in the 
                        spring and work hard for football next season so our record 
                        can be even better.  Thank you for finding out a little 
                        bit about me and feel free to explore the rest of my portfolio.

                        This winter/spring I started my first season of highschool 
                        baseball.  I was coming off of a broken finger from football 
                        and I wasn't really confident in my abilities that I was used
                        to using.  I am a pretty good baseball player or at least I was 
                        before highschool, but I wasn't truly ready.  I started the 
                        season off on a bad note.  Before I knew it my ERA was in 
                        teh double digits and I was hitting in the 7 spot. My entire 
                        life I had been hitting in the top 5 of the lineup so I was
                        shocked.  However this was warranted.  I wasn't playing well 
                        and it was showing. So I started putting in more hours with
                        other coaches and just hitting in my garage.  I started 
                        throwing more and for longer.  I was getting my velocity that
                        I used to have back.  I could play baseball again.  Now nearing the 
                        end of the season my team has a positive record and we are facing our 
                        rivals Dougherty Valley.  If we win this game we will be solidified as
                        one of the best teams in our league.  Lets see how that goes.
