                    <p>I love sports.  I have played sports since I was barely 
                    able to walk and I usually excelled at whatever I participated in.
                    I also love food, I have been eating my entire life.
                    I used to only eat junk food all the time but recently
                    I have been eating a lot better and have gotten more in shape.  
                    Football also helped a ton with that aspect of my life.  
                    I only just started playing Football as an actual organized sport 
                    however my main sport that i've played my whole life is Baseball.
                    This isn't all about sports though.  Let me tell you more about me as a person. 
                    I am 15 years old and a student in Dublin Californa. My family is 
                    pretty normal compared to some other people. My family consists of
                    my mom, dad and younger sister.  I have lived in Dublin for about 6 
                    years or so but before that I lived in Fremont and even before 
                    that I lived in Delaware on the east coast. I have always loved 
                    Philadelphia sports teams because my parets are both from Philadelphia.</p>
