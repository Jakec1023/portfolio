            <p class="card-text">In my Computer Science Principles class one of 
            our first projects had to do with the Scratch programming language.  
            We started with this language because it is generally considered a 
            pretty basic language.  I worked with a partner and even though we were 
            pretty new to programming.  However I feel that we both did our part to complete 
            the project.  We worked together and decided to come up with a mix 
            between Super Mario Bros. and Super Smash Bros.  We worked on the
            layout of the game while in class and while at home.  However the 
            homework was more one sided because I didn't have access to a shared 
            game file from my home computer.
