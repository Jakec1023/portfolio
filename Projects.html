            <h5>Objective of Project: <p>Create a Multi-Level Game with Increasing Difficulty</p></h5>
            <p class="card-text">In my Computer Science Principles class I was 
            assigned this project for our first actual programming project of the semester.  
            For this project my partner and I were required to create a video game
            using the Scratch programming language. My role in the project was to
            complete and turn in our project notebook as well as code on a minor scale,
            while my partner had a more major role in the coding, and a minor role for the project notebook.
            While working on the project the most important thing I learned was to 
            manage my time. It may seem simple, however, this project was time consuming,
            so it allowed my partner and I to plan out everything in order get things
            done on time. One thing this project challenged my partner and I with
            was procrastination.  However after we had gotten a few days into the project 
            and were behind a bit we knew that we would have to pick up the pace
            on our project.  We pushed past this and eventually finished the project.
            Both my partner and I worked hard and finished the project with an A- and felt that 
            in the time that we had we completed the project to the best of our ability.

            <h5>Duration of Project: <p>January 23rd-February 5th</p></h5>
            <h5>Objective of Project: <p>Create a Working Hangman Game Using a Specific Python Function</p></h5>
            <p class="card-text">This project was started going into the second semester 
            after winter break.  We had been studying the coding language Python and our
            teacher assigned the class this mini project.  Our job was to create a working
            hangman game with our own original topic using a specific Python function given 
            to us by our teacher.  Because we had just gone over loops that was a very large 
            large part of our project.  For this project I took the role of the writing the
            code and making sure our code worked.  Because our class was still mostly new to
            loops we struggled a bit on this project.  At least my partner and I struggled.  
            We were somewhat behind going into the last week of the project so we really put 
            almost all of our free time into the project during that last week.  We ended up 
            recieving an 100% on the project and ours was one of the smoothest running games
            in the class. Both my partner and I performed to the utmpost of our ability 
            during this project.
