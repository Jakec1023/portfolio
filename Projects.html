            <h5>Duration of Project: <p>August 30th-September 7th</p></h5>
            <h5>Objective of Project: <p>Create a Multi-Level Game with Increasing Difficulty</p></h5>
            <p class="card-text">In my Computer Science Principles class I was 
            assigned this Project for our first actual programming project of the semester.  
            For this project my partner and I were required to create a video game
            using the Scratch programming language. My role in the project was to
            complete and turn in our project notebook as well as code on a minor scale,
            while my partner had a more major role in the coding, and a minor role for the project notebook.
            While working on the project the most important thing I linked was to 
            manage my time. It may seem simple however this project was time consuming,
            so it allowed my partner and I to plan out everything in order get things
            done on time. One thing this project challenged my partner and I with
            was procrastination.  However after we had gotten a few days into the project 
            and were behind a bit we knew that we would have to pick up the pace
            on our project.  We pushed past this and eventually finished the project.
            Both my partner and I worked hard and finished the project with an A- and felt that 
            in the time that we had we completed the project to the best of our ability.
