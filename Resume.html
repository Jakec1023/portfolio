                    <li>
                        After I complete Highschool at Dublin High, I would like to 
                        move forward and recieve a higher education in college and 
                        eventually move into the work force.

                    <li>
                        I am currently in my first year attending Highschool at 
                        Dublin High in Dublin, California.

                    <li>
                        My required classes that I have taken this year are 
                        Geometry, Biology, Physical Education, and Spanish Two.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        My main college interest is somewhere close to home, 
                        hopefully a state College that will recruit me for a sport.
                        I haven't started looking yet, seeing as I am a Freshman and
                        haven't been fully exposed to the College atmosphere.

                    <li>
                        If I did have a college I was looking to go to, it would 
                        probably be UC Berkely with a focus on business.

                        On May 26th 2018, I volunteered for the Challenger Jamboree 
                        to help out children with special needs to play baseball. 
                        I was acting as a volunteer Buddy, meaning that I helped 
                        the kids run around the bases and I got to hang out with 
                        them in the dugout.

                        Over the last 2017-2018 school year and for this first 
                        semester of this 2018-2019 school year I have been studying
                        Spanish for my graduation requirement of a foreign language.
                        I am by no means fluent however I do have an A in the class
                        and I held an A last year in the class as well.

                        Last year, I recieved a certificate only given to a few 
                        students in Dublin which was awarded to me for recognition 
                        of positive character traits.

                    <li>
                        I was awarded the MVP award for the Freshman Football 
                        season by my coach because of my performance on the Defensive
                        and Offensive Line
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        I also received a certificate for managing a 3.71 grade 
                        point average along with competing during football. This
                        certificate shows that I was an outstanding student athlete.
